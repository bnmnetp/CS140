    "Relational Algebra forms the basis for relational databases and the SQL query language.  In many ways understanding relational algebra is better than learning SQL right away as it is very consistent and extensible.  It is consitent because every relational algebra operator takes one or more relations as input and produces a relation as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the relational operators we can answer many questions.  In fact once you have mastered the relational operators it is almost trivial to translate a series of relational operators into SQL for use with the database of your choice.  As is the case with many aspects of computer science, any one of these relational operators is easy to understand in isolation, it is the combination of the operators that allows us to answer very complex questions.\n"

    "A relation is one of the fundamental units of data used in Relational Algebra.  A relation is a collection of **tuples** where each tuple is composed of data.  The data in these tuples is in a consistent order, and would typically represent a collection of information about a particular entity.   To put it in terms you are probably more familiar with, a relation is like a spreadsheet, that consists of rows and columns of data.  The entire spreadsheet corresponds to the relation, and a row of the spreadsheet corresponds to a tuple.  In this notebook we will use two simple relations, a City relation and a Country relation.\n",
